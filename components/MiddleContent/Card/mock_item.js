  selftext: 'This happened last week, he\'s only 11. At around 10AM my son was taken out of class by the schools resource officer and lead to the main office where 4 other officers were waiting for him.\n\nThey then patted him down, and took him (not handcuffed) to the police station and began looking though his phone, emails, messages, everything. The biggest issue is NO ONE CALLED US. Not the school, not the police no one. We got a text from a friend of his who had our number asking us if he was still coming over after school since he left class early and had not come back yet (this was at 1PM).\n\nWe called the school who only told us to call the police department as this wasn\'t a school issue anymore. We start freaking out wondering where our son is or what happened to him, my husband who\'s more level headed just tracked his iPhone and seen where he was and we headed there.\n\nWe got there at maybe 1:15PM and were completely stonewalled. No one told us anything except he\'s being investigated for a planned school shooting. Which is just insane, he doesn\'t do anything crazy and talks to us pretty openly about everything. He spends his time at school, with friends building forts or playing Nerf guns (this is important later).\n\nWe continued to demand to see our son, and called a friend of ours who works for the state as a social worker. She wasn\'t able to get down there or figure anything out until about 6:30PM and finally after she started calling people did they release him at 7PM. They did not let us speak to our son or see him this entire time.\n\nWe get him home and get tells us everything, apparently him and his friend were talking about their "guns". Nerf guns, and what they were going to go hunt after school when they came back to our house for the night and dinner. They never spoke about shooting people or schools or anything, they were going to hunt "Creepers" from their Minecraft game. They painted some boxes green and what not and set them up around the yard and house and do this pretty regularly.\n\nWhen they finally let him go some guy in a suit says "sorry, we received a credible report about a planned school shooting from a teacher and had to act. We\'ve concluded he was talking about a video game with his friend and he\'s free to go" that\'s not verbatim but it\'s pretty much what he said.\n\nThey kept offering him McDonald\'s, giving him soda and candy etc if he just told them where the guns were or to draw out the plans and who was involved. They asked him if we drink, if we have any pills in our medicine cabinet we take and then sleep or "do weird things" after taking or smoking etc. They kept going through his phone and asking him "where is this picture taken" or "who was there" like wtf they questioned him for 9 hours, entirely invaded his and our privacy on the phone and didn\'t let us see or talk to him.\n\nThe school is refusing to talk to us at all other than they graciously said he is okay to come back to school once they finish speaking to the police, maybe. We can\'t get answers if he is suspended or if he can even goto school and the police department keeps telling us "the issue is closed" and hangup. What the hell do we do?\n\nEdit: forgot to add that they made him login to his phone, and email and everything else with his passwords.',
